# Web UI

## Primitives

Controls come from [`components/ui`](../../apps/web/src/components/ui).
[AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md#taste) says how to use and extend them.

Don't style a raw `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, or `<textarea>` to look like a control a
primitive provides. Raw elements are right when the element isn't that control: semantic rows, tabs,
resize handles, swatches, editor surfaces, anything whose behavior or geometry differs by design.

## Styles

Style with Tailwind classes in the component that renders the element.

- Global CSS, in [`index.css`](../../apps/web/src/index.css) or any other stylesheet, is only for
  what classes on the owning component can't express: generated Markdown or imperative DOM, custom
  elements and shadow roots, animations, runtime theme variables, and browser or Electron
  integration.
- No `style={{ ... }}` or inline `<style>` for static values a class covers. Values computed at
  runtime are fine.
- Theme-only rules use `@variant dark` and `@variant light`, not `.dark` selectors.

## Theme CSS hooks

Themes can carry CSS ([user guide](../user/custom-css.md)) that targets `data-t3-part`
attributes. Those names are a public contract with users' themes: renaming or removing one, or
moving it to an element with a different role, silently breaks themes nobody here can see. Keep
the part on the element when restructuring, and add a part when a new region is one people will
want to restyle. Parts must not change the default look; a slot that only exists for themes, such
as `thread-project`, renders hidden.

Parts are listed once, in [`themeCssReference.ts`](../../packages/shared/src/themeCssReference.ts),
which feeds the user guide (`node scripts/sync-theme-css-docs.ts`) and the `t3_theme_guide` MCP
tool agents read. A test fails when that list and the parts the web app renders disagree.

## Composition

The composer banners are the reference.

- [`ComposerBanner.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerBanner.tsx) exports one object
  of small slots. Slots own their classes, take `className`, and spread the rest of their props,
  merging classes with `cn`. Variants and density are props on `Root`. A slot that needs a control
  renders `Button`.
- [`ComposerBannerStack.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerBannerStack.tsx) composes
  the slots and owns only stack behavior: priority, expand and collapse, dismiss transitions.
- Consumers are a few lines of slots, and the slots carry the styling:
  [`ComposerActivityStatus.tsx`](../../apps/web/src/components/chat/ComposerActivityStatus.tsx).

Build new UI the same way. Compose or extend a component instead of copying its markup and classes.
When a call site repeats a treatment another one already uses, make it a variant or a slot on the
shared component. A new composer banner or notice uses the `ComposerBanner` slots.
