// Presence's voice wave (KAL-1472, A18): one pipeline for both voices, Tim's (listening) and the
// agent's (speaking). An analyser's byte spectrum (fftSize 2048, 1024 bins, smoothing 0.8, as the
// ElevenLabs SDK sets up its own) goes into 64 log-spaced bands over the voice range only (to
// VOICE_TOP), each band its loudest bin, eased in time (fast up, a little slower down), blended with
// its neighbours so harmonics never comb, then laid once across the whole line, low notes left,
// under a window that keeps both ends put. Never mirrored: position u along the line is one band.
// The two voices differ only in height (light.mjs). Pure functions over preallocated arrays, no
// DOM and no allocation per frame: light.mjs runs it per frame and the tests feed it spectra.
