// Presence (KAL-1472): only speech moves the listening wave. Taps, clicks and knocks on the table
// reach the microphone too; the line ignores them (what goes to ElevenLabs is untouched: this reads
// the SDK's analyser, it never filters the stream). Two parts, both on the SDK's input spectrum
// (1024 bins, 100 Hz to 8 kHz, linear, about 7.7 Hz a bin):
//   band   only bins up to about 3.5 kHz shape the wave (the voice range; the SDK's floor is 100 Hz),
//          the same as a band-pass in front of the analyser, for the animation only
//   gate   the line moves only while the sound is voiced: a voice is a comb of harmonics (a pitch of
//          85 to 400 Hz), a knock or a click is a few inharmonic modes or broadband noise. The gate
//          opens after the comb has held for about 80 ms (quick), and closes slowly once it is gone
//          for a moment, so syllables and the gaps between words keep it open.
// Pure functions of the bytes, no DOM: light.mjs runs it per frame and the tests feed it spectra.
