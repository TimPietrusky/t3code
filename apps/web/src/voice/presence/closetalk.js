// The close-talk gate: only Tim talking straight into the phone counts (21 Oct 2026). Walking the
// dog, a shout down the street, people talking a few metres away or a TV next door are speech too,
// and ElevenLabs took them for turns: they cut Presence off mid-sentence and, on the page, flipped
// thinking back to listening. Tim's own voice, a hand's width from the microphone, is far louder
// than all of that, so the gate is a level gate against two references it measures as it goes:
//
//   floor  the ambient level (the quiet between sounds), tracked down fast and up slowly, frozen
//          while the gate is open or Presence speaks (her echo is not the street);
//   voice  Tim's close voice: how loud his turns are, learned from each turn he takes (clamped, so
//          noise that slips through cannot drag it down far).
//
// Speech counts when it is MARGIN dB over the floor, within VOICE_RANGE dB of Tim's voice and over
// ABS_MIN, for ATTACK_MS. However loud the floor, the bar stays HEADROOM dB under Tim's own voice:
// he is never locked out by wind or a road (22 Oct). While Presence speaks the bar is BARGE dB higher and must hold for
// BARGE_MS (about 300 ms of clearly-Tim); while she thinks (a tool runs, a reply is on its way) it
// is higher again and longer: no barge-in at all unless Tim says "stop" or "wait" loudly and close.
// Once open, Tim keeps the floor through his pauses (KEEP dB of hysteresis, HOLD_MS after his last
// loud sound). `sensitivity` (-2..2, Tim's "be less/more sensitive", prefs.mjs) moves every bar by
// STEP dB.
//
// Tim's sentence goes on after Presence took the turn: ElevenLabs ended his turn in a pause and
// thinks, but he is not done. Within CONTINUE_MS of his last close sound the thinking bar is the
// listening bar, so the rest of his sentence reaches ElevenLabs (and stops her reply) instead of
// being cut as noise.
//
// `voiced` is the page's own word on someone talking close to the phone (turns.mjs: nothing Presence
// starts by herself goes in while it is true): the listening bar (the speaking one while she talks,
// her echo is not Tim), ATTACK_MS to start, HOLD_MS of quiet to end, and no stage can say no to it.
// So Tim talking while the gate is held shut (learning his voice, the speaker check not yet sure, a
// thinking bar he does not reach) is still Tim talking.
//
// Stages: a later check (on-device VAD, Tim's enrolled voice) plugs in with `stage(name, verdict)`.
// false holds the gate shut, true or null leave it to the levels; the gate opens only when the
// levels say so and no stage says no. A stage fails open: one that has never said true in this
// gate's life can hold it shut for UNPROVEN_MS of someone talking close (SPEAKER_UNPROVEN_MS for
// the speaker check Tim turned on: another voice talking first stays out), then it no longer counts
// until it says true once (22 Oct: Tim's iPhone, a stage said no to every word and three calls sent
// ElevenLabs nothing but silence; a check that never hears him is broken, not proof). `enroll` is
// deliberate (Presence must not answer while he teaches her his voice) and always counts. The decision is `step()`, one function, pure: the audio
// worklet (closetalk-worklet.js) runs it on Tim's microphone and tests run it on synthetic traces.
